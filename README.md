# FF Minecraft SMP Season 8

Based on the modpack All Of Fabric 3 with our own modifications

[Latest Releases](https://github.com/HumanMint/FFMCS8/releases)

Known Issues

- [IMPORTANT] DO NOT GO NEAR X -1693 Z -434. It will instantly crash the server and give 5 minutes of setback to everyone on the server. We don't know what causes this crash yet, as soon as we find out which mod crashes this part of the map we will lift the ban of accessing this place.
	- Solution: DON'T GO NEAR X -1693 Z -434

- When Canvas mod is installed, some campanion items crash the game when placed down (like rope bridge when on "in progress" stage).
	- Solution: Temporarily uninstall Canvas mod when setting up the campanion items, and when done you may re-load Canvas.
	
- When opening your inventory with REI (Roughly Enough Items) enabled as soon as you access a different dimension (going through portal) it may crash your client.
	- Solution: Hide REI using Ctrl+O when inventory is open to avoid crashes when going through dimensions.
