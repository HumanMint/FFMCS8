# FF Minecraft SMP Season 8

Based on the modpack All Of Fabric 3 with our own modifications

[Latest Releases](https://github.com/HumanMint/FFMCS8/releases)

Known Issues

- When Canvas mod is installed, some campanion items crash the game when placed down (like rope bridge when on "in progress" stage).
	- Solution: Temporarily uninstall Canvas mod when setting up the campanion items, and when done you may re-load Canvas.
	
- When opening your inventory with REI (Roughly Enough Items) enabled as soon as you access a different dimension (going through portal) it may crash your client.
	- Solution: Hide REI using Ctrl+O when inventory is open to avoid crashes when going through dimensions.
